# BODY-FAT-ESTIMATION
Percentage of body fat, age, weight, height, and ten body circumference measurements (e.g., abdomen) are recorded for 252 men. Body fat, one measure of health, has been accurately estimated by an underwater weighing technique. Fitting body fat to the other measurements using multiple regression provides a convenient way of estimating body fat for men using only a scale and a measuring tape. In this assignment, you will be looking at the bodyfat dataset (Links to an external site.) and build several models on top of it.
